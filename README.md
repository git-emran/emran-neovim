## How to use
Lazyvim - Neovim

Prerequisite: A little bit of [Lua](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) knowledge

My setup is so easy that you can copy it in just 4 steps. 

1. Clone this repository into your Neovim config directory:
[git clone https://github.com/git-emran/emran-neovim.git ~/.config/nvim]

2. Recreate my Folder structure. For example: options folder (for all neovim options), keymaps folder (for all keybindings), plugins folder (for all plugins) and etc.

3. Create your custom init.lua file in your .config/nvim directory.

4. Paste my init.lua content and run " :Lazy sync "
