1. Clone this repository into your Neovim config directory:
[git clone https://github.com/git-emran/emran-neovim.git ~/.config/nvim]

2. Create your custom init.lua file in your .config/nvim directory. 

3. Go through the Plugins folder in my repo, copy & paste the custom styled plugins with easy to follow keybindings. 

4. Then just simply - require("your.plugins") - like this in your init.lua file. 

#NOTE: BASIC LUA KNOWLEDGE is not necessary but nice to have!!!

Enjoy NeoVim
